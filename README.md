# Higher or Lower: Spotify Edition

A recreation of my original [Higher or Lower: Anime Edition](https://github.com/ChickenCombo/higher-or-lower-anime) game, but using React and Spotify's data.

A Spotify web scraper has also been programmed using [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/) that scrapes the artist's name, monthly listeners, and the artist's image, to make it easier to update the game's data.
